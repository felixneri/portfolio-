                Soon the ZitnetAcademy curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning.Instead of series of coding 
                challenges ,you'll through building project- step by step. Before will get into details let me emphasize:
                we are not changing the certificates.All the  certificate will still have 5 the same require projects.
                we are only the optional coding challenges.
            </p>
            <p>After years-years-of ponding these two problem and how to solve them ,
                I slipped hit my head on the sink, and when I came to I had a revelation! A vission! A  picture in my head!
                A picture this! this is what makes time travel possible: the flux capicator!
            </p>
            <P> It was'nt as dramatic as doc'cs the revelation in the back to the future.
                It just occure to me while i was going for a run . the revelation:the entire curriculumshould be in project.
                Instead of individual coding challenges, we 'll just have project .each with each with their own seamless
                series of tests.Each test just gives you enouch information to figure out how to get it  to pass.
                (And you can view hints if that isn't enouch).
            </P>
            <blockquote><hr><p  class="quote"> the entire curriculum should be a series of project</p><hr></blockquote> 
            <p>No more walls of exp,lanatry test.No more walls of test. just one test at a time, you will biuld up a working 
                project .over the course of passing thousand of tests.you   build up project on your own understanding
                of coding fandumentals.there is not transition between lesson and project becuase the lesson themselves are bake
                into project.And there is plenty of repitation to help you retain because-hey-building a projects in real life has 
                plenty of repitation.
            </p>
            <p>The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of explanation and instruction
               an packing them into single text description text.Each project will involve dozens of text like this.
               people will be coding the entire time rather than switching back and forth,from reading mode to coding mode.
            </p>
            <P>Instead of coding challenges, poeple will be in their code editor passing one text after another
                quickly building of a project.poeple will go into a flow state,similar to what their experience
                when then they build the require project at the end of each certificate.They'll get that sense of forward
                progress right from the beginning.and FREECODECAMP will be a much smoother experience.
            </P>

                        <p>
                            We launched ZitnetAcademy with a simple list of 15 resources, include harvad's 
                            cs50 and standford's database class
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We added interactive algorithms challenges

                        <p>
                             We added our own HTML+CSS challenges 
                             (before we'd been relying on General Assembly's Dash course for these).  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front End, Back End, 
                            and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges. 
                            For the other certs, we were still using external resources like Node School.

                        <p>
                            We added the back end and data visualization challenges.

                            We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. 
                            This was the biggest curriculum improvement to date.
